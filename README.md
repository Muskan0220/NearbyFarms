Nearby Farms allows you to search for the farmers and their farming land in your locality. When you find a farmer who offers your desired product, you can talk to an automated chat robot to ask for other specifications. Once you are done, the chat robot will notify the farmer about your purchase. Then you can either walk or bike to pick your order. You can also make a list of favorite farmers for the next purchases.

Local farmers are more accountable to their local communities, so you can expect safe and super quality goods. In the process, you also build a relationship with the person who provides your food.
